Quantum Walks with time-dependent Hamiltonians:
application to the search problem on graphs

This code is a rewritten version of the code used for my bachelor thesis
at the University of Milan. The old version can be found at my github page
github.com/mgarbellini.

Major features and enhancement compare to
the previous version.

- QW Spatial search on graph with time-independent Hamiltonian (see Fahri & Gutmann)
- QW Spatial search with time-dependent Hamiltonian
- Different graph topology implemented: circle, complete, random, star, etc..


- Robustness of the approach
- Localization and Multiple iteration search
